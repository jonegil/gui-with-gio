# Chapter 8 - Custom graphics - a circle

## Goals

The intent of this section is to draw custom graphics that (vaguely) resembles an egg

![Egg as circle](08_egg_as_circle.gif)

## Outline

The code introduces custom graphics. The circle in the app is drawn by Gio, not displaying a static picture. Tho achieve that we combine

- A **clip** to define the area we can draw within
- A **paint** operation to fill that area
- Some parameters to set color

## Imports

There are some new imports, namely

- [image](https://pkg.go.dev/image) and [image/color](https://pkg.go.dev/image/color), Go's standard 2D image library.

  - Nigel Tao [writes well](https://blog.golang.org/image) about these packages on the Go blog.

- [f32](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/f32). Go's image library is based on `int`, while Gio for some of its functions works with `float32`. Hence f32 reimplements floating point versions of the two main types, `Points` and `Rectangles`.

- [op/clip](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/op/clip) is used to define an area to paint within. Drawing outside this area is ignored.

- [op/paint](https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/op/paint) contains drawing operations to fill a shape with color.

## Points and Rectangles

Points and Rectangles are used extensively, so it's worth quoting from Nigel's blog mentioned above. Point's are coordinates and Rectangles are defined by Points:

```go
type Point struct {
    X, Y float32
}

type Rectangle struct {
    Min, Max Point
}
```

A Point is an X, Y coordinate pair. The axes increase right and down (origin = top left corner). It is neither a pixel nor a grid square. A Point has no intrinsic width, height or color, but the visualizations below use a small colored square.
![Point](08_image_package_point.png)

```go
p := image.Point{2, 1}
```

A Rectangle contains the points with Min.X <= X < Max.X, Min.Y <= Y < Max.Y. It has no intrinsic color, but the visualization below outlines it with a thin colored line, and call out their Min and Max Points.

![Rectangle](08_image_package_rectangle.png)

```go
r := image.Rect(2, 1, 5, 5)
```

For convenience, image.Rect(x0, y0, x1, y1) is equivalent to `Rectangle{Point{x0, y0}, Point{x1, y1}}`, but is much easier to type. It also swaps Minimum and Maximum to ensure it's well formed.

That's it. Let's look at the code:

## Code

```go
layout.Rigid(
  func(gtx C) D {
    circle := clip.Ellipse{
       // Hard coding the x coordinate. Try resizing the window
       Min: image.Pt(80, 0),
       Max: image.Pt(320, 240),
       // Soft coding the x coordinate. Try resizing the window
       //Min: image.Pt(gtx.Constraints.Max.X/2-120, 0),
       //Max: image.Pt(gtx.Constraints.Max.X/2+120, 240),
    }.Op(gtx.Ops)
    color := color.NRGBA{R: 200, A: 255}
    paint.FillShape(gtx.Ops, color, circle)
    d := image.Point{Y: 400}
    return layout.Dimensions{Size: d}
  },
),
```

## Comments

We first define a circle using `clip.Ellipse{ }`. It defines circle as an `Ellipse` within a box, where the dimensions of the box are specified by the top left and bottom right corners. `Min` and `Max` respectively.

In the code the circle is hard coded, but try to resize the window and you'll see that might not necessarily be what you want. To adjust, simply comment the hard-coded coordinates and uncomment the next two lines which introduce dynamic positioning. You can play around with these dimensions, familiarizing yourself with when the circle moves up or down, depending in wheiter you resize the window or move the limiting box around the Ellipse.

**Gotcha:** If you are lucky enough to work with a High DPI display, and happen to run it with a scaling factor of, say 125%, another problem with the hard coded coordinates will surface. Gio works well with `Dp`, **D**isplay independent **p**ixels, which ensures that 1 Dp will have the same apparent size across displays and resolutions. When hard-coding like here, that dynamic is overruled. A 125% resolution scale will translate the **400 Dp** wide window (as defined in `app.NewWindow`) into a **500 pixels** context. You can see this my inspecting `gtx.Constrains` and convert pixels to Dp by `gtx.Dp()`. 

`color.NRGBA` defines the color of the circle. Note that the Alpha-channel defaults to 0, i.e. invisible, so we lift it to 255 so we can actually see it.

`paint.FillShape` fills the shape with the `color`.

And finally we return the widget in the form of its `Dimensions`, height: 400.
