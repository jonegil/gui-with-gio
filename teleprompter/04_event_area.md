ThatÂ´s it. We've got yet another Gio project in our belt, great work!. This one was all about processing input, which we did by listening to events, `key.Event` and `pointer.Event` respectively, and using custom logic to update a set of state variables. Later, in `system.FrameEvent` we used those state variables to control our layout.

Thank you again so much for following the writeup. If you found this useful, share it with a friend, star it on Github or drop me a line. It's really motivating to hear back from you. Good luck with all your projects!
